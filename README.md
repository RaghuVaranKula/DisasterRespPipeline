## Why This Matters

In the aftermath of a disaster, every moment is critical. Emergency teams struggle to process the flood of information. The Disaster Response Pipeline Project cuts through the noise, categorizing messages and alerts in real time, ensuring that help arrives where it's needed most, efficiently and effectively.

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3.7
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn for ML; NLTK for NLP; SQLAlchemy for database operations; Flask and Plotly for web app and data visualization.
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight and efficient data storage.
- **Machine Learning**: Custom-built classification models trained on real-world data.

## Setup & Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.5+ installed. Clone this repository to get started:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/matteobonanomi/disaster-response.git
cd disaster-response
```
Install dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How It Works

**ETL Pipeline**: Extract data from source, clean, and store it in a SQLite database.
**ML Pipeline**: Train a model to classify disaster messages into categories.
**Web App**: Visualize the results and provide an interface for real-time classification.

### Running the Application:
**1.Prepare the data and model**:

```shell
python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
```
**2.Launch the web app**:
```shell
python app/run.py
```
